What's new in qiBuild 1.14
---------------------------


* qibuild is now available for Archlinux in the  `AUR <http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58398>`_

* Much better support of XCode and compilation on mac in general

* Using upstream's CMake files for Qt and Boost.

* Fixed performance issues when calling ``cmake ..`` (something you often
  do when using QtCreator, for instance) after the first `qibuild configure`.

* Added support for other 3rd party binary packages. You can now use
  `qibuild import-package` to import a gentoo binary packages to a qibuild
  toolchain.
