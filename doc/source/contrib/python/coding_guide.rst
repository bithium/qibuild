Python coding guide
===================

.. highlight:: python

General
-------

* The code should follow the Python coding style expressed in
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP8 with the following
  reminders/exceptions

* Keep the length of the line below *80* characters when possible,
  and when it does not hurt readability, and below *100* characters
  at any case.

* Indentation is made of *four spaces*

* No trailing whitespace are allowed.

* Every text file must be pushed using *UNIX line endings*. (On windows, you
  are advised to set ``core.autocrlf`` to true).

* Variables, functions and modules are named ``like_this``
  *lower case, underscore*

* Classes are named ``LikeThis`` *camel case*

* Constants and globals are named ``LIKE_THIS`` *upper case, underscore*

* Please use a spell checker when you write comments. Typos in
  comments are annoying and distractive, typos in doc strings are
  bad because we generate public documentation from some of those
  doc strings.

* The `Google Python Style Guide <http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html>`_ contains
  lots of useful things, please read it.

Do not just copy/paste code from the Internet
----------------------------------------------

It's perfectly fine to look on the Internet for a solution
of your problem.

If you find a snippet of code you want to copy/paste, please:

* check the license if any (qiBuild must stay BSD compatible, so
  no GPL code, please)
* format it first
* fix the style if necessary
* cite the origin of your code, either in a comment, or for
  bigger code, in the README.rst


Always specify optional arguments explicitly
--------------------------------------------

When you have a function looking like ::

    def foo(project, config=None):
        """ run foo on the given project

        """

Python will let you use ``foo(my_proj, "linux32")``,
automatically converting the regular argument ``linux32`` into the
optional argument named ``config``

Please don't do that and use the explicit form instead ::

      # in bar.py

      # BAD : second argument is in fact an optional
      # argument
      foo(my_proj, "linux32")

      # OK: the optional argument is explicit:
      foo(my_proj, config="linux32")


This can cause problems if someone ever changes the ``foo`` function and adds a
new optional argument *before* ``config``::

    def foo(project, clean=False, config=None):
        """ run foo on the given project
        :param clean: ...

        """

The line in ``bar.py`` will call ``foo()`` with ``clean="linux32"``
and ``config=None``, leading to interesting bugs.

Use the standard library
-------------------------

There are lots of good modules in the Python standard library:
http://docs.python.org/library/

Please have a look here before re-inventing the wheel.

Some examples:

* `pprint <http://docs.python.org/library/pprint.html>`_, instead of trying to rewrite complex ``__str__`` functions

* `itertools <http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html>`_, instead of writing for loops.

* ``my_string.ljust()``  instead of writing custom padding code

* ``max(my_list)`` instead of writing a loop to compute the biggest element

* ``my_list = set(a_list_with_duplicates)`` to remove the duplicates from a list.


Doc strings
------------

Right now the state of the docstrings inside qiBuild are quite a mess.

But you should try to write docstrings as if all of them were going
to be used with `sphinx autodoc extension <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html>`_.

Also, please follow `PEP 257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257>`_

* Multi-line doc strings should end by a blank line and an indented ``"""``
  on its own line

So the canonical docstring should look like:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(bar, baz):
        """Does this and that
        :param bar: ...
        :param baz: ...

        :raise: MyError if ...
        :return: True if ...

        """

But please do not put too much in the doc string, we want to keep
the code readable.

.. code-block:: python

    # Bad: too much stuff here

    def foo(bar, baz):
        """ Does this and that
        :param bar: ...
        :param baz: ...

        :raise: MyError if ...
        :return: True if ...

        .. seealso:

            * :ref:`this-other-topic`

        Example ::

          bar = Bar()
          baz = Baz()
          f = foo(bar, baz)

        """

Rather use the modularity of ``autodoc``:

.. code-block:: python

    # OK: still readable

    def foo(bar, baz):
        """ Does this and that
        :param bar: ...
        :param baz: ...

        :raise: MyError if ...
        :return: True if ...


        """


.. code-block:: rst

  .. autofunction:: qibuild.toc.toc_open

  .. seealso:

    * :ref:`this-other-topic`

   Example

   .. code-block:: python

        bar = Bar()
        baz = Baz()
        f = foo(bar, baz)




For easy code re-use
--------------------


* *Every file* that ends with a .py *must* support to be imported, without
  doing anything or printing anything to the screen.

* ``import foo`` must never fails, unless there's a necessary module that could
  not be found. But do not catch the ImportError unless it is necessary, for
  instance to deal with optional dependencies ::

    import required_module

    HAS_NICE_FEATURE = True
    try:
      import nicefeature
    except ImportError:
      HAS_NICE_FEATURE = False

    ...

    if HAS_NICE_FEATURE:
      ....



* Even if you are sure you code is standalone, and is only supposed to be used
  as a script, please follow the following skeleton::

    """The foo script adds spam to the eggs """

    def add_eggs(spam, eggs):
      """Add some spam to the eggs """

      ...


    def main():
      """Parse command line """

      ...

      add_eggs(spam, eggs)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

Note that the ``main()`` function does nothing but parsing command line, the real
work being done by a nicely named ``add_eggs`` function.

Unless you have a good reason too, please do not call ``sys.exit()`` outside the
``main()`` function.

You will be glad to have written your ``foo.py`` script this way if you want to
add some spam to the eggs somewhere else :)


* Please avoid doing lots and lots of import at the beginning of
  the file::

    # BAD:
    import foo
    from foo.spam import Spam
    from foo.eggs import Eggs

    ...

    spam = Spam()
    eggs = Eggs()


    # OK:
    import foo

    ...

    spam = foo.spam.Spam()

    eggs = foo.eggs.Eggs()


For this to work, you will have to put something like this in
``foo/__init__.py`` ::

  from foo import spam
  from foo import eggs


File Paths
----------

* **Never** use strings to manipulate file paths. Use ``os.path.join``
  which will handle all the nasty stuff for you::

    # BAD : you are doomed if you ever want to
    # generate a .bat file with bar_path
    bar_path = spam_path + "/" + "bar"

    # OK:
    bar_path = os.path.join(spam_path, "bar")

* When using ``os.path.join``, use one argument per file part::

    # BAD: you can end up with an ugly path like c:\path\to/foo/bar
    my_path = os.path.join(base_dir, "foo/bar")

    # OK:
    my_path = os.path.join(base_dir, "foo", "bar")


* **Always** convert files coming from the user to native, absolute path::

    user_input = ...
    my_path = qibuild.sh.to_native_path(user_input)

* Always store and manipulate native paths (using ``os.path``), and if needed
  convert to POSIX or Windows format at the last moment.

.. note:: If you need to build POSIX paths, don't use string operations
   either, use `posixpath.join`  (This works really well to build URL, for
   instance)

* Pro-tip: hard-coding paths on Windows:

Use `r"` rather than ugly `\\\\` ::

  # UGLY:
  WIN_PATH = "c:\\windows\\spam\\eggs"

  # NICE:
  WIN_PATH = r"c:\windows\spam\eggs"


Environment Variables
---------------------

Please make sure to **never** modify ``os.environ``

Remember that ``os.environ`` is in fact a huge global variable, and we all know
it's a bad idea to use global variables ...

Instead, use a copy of ``os.environ``, for instance::

  import qibuild

  # Note the .copy() !
  # If you forget it, build_env is a *reference* to
  # os.environ, so os.environ will be modified ...
  cmd_env = os.environ.copy()
  cmd_env["SPAM"] = "eggs"
  # Assuming foobar need SPAM environment variable set to 'eggs'
  cmd = ["foobar"]
  qibuild.command.call(foobar, env=cmd_env)


In more complex cases, especially when handling the
%PATH% environment variable, you can use ``qibuild.envsetter.EnvSetter``.

A small example::

  import qibuild

  envsetter = qibuild.envsetter.EnvSetter()
  envsetter.prepend_to_path(r"c:\Program Files\Foobar\bin")
  build_env = envsetter.get_build_env()
  cmd = ["foobar", "/spam:eggs"]
  qibuild.command.call(cmd, env=build_env)


Platform-dependent code
-----------------------

Please use::

  import qibuild
  platform = qibuild.get_platform()

  if platform == "linux":
     do_linux()
  elif platform == "mac":
    do_mac()
  elif platform == "windows":
    do_windows()


And do not use ``sys.platform`` directly. This way
if when we add a new supported platform to ``qibuild``, we will
know where to patch the code.

Using this is also a good way to do it ::

  import os

  if os.name() == 'posix':
     # POSIX code
  elif os.name() == 'nt':
     # Windows specific code


Output messages to the user
-----------------------------

* Please use ``qibuild.ui`` to print nice message to the user and not
  just ``print``.
  This makes it easier to distinguish between real messages and
  the quick ``printf`` you add for debugging.

* Speaking of debug, the tricky parts of qibuild contains some calls to
  ``qibuild.ui.debug`` that are only triggered when using ``-v, --verbose``.
  Don't hesitate to use that, especially when something tricky is going on
  but you do not want to tell the user about it.

* In the past, we were using ``logging.py`` and a custom log handler to output
  messages to the console. This was causing lots of problems, and we added
  a compatibility layer to avoid having to modify to much code.
  But please do not use ``qibuild.log`` in new code:

.. code-block:: python

  # Don't do this:

  import qibuild.log

  logger = qibuild.log.get_logger(__name__)
  logger.info("Building :%s", project.name)

  # Do this instead:

  import qibuild.ui
  qibuild.ui.info("Building", project.name)


Debugging
---------

When something goes wrong, you will just have the last error message printed,
with no other information. (Which is nice for the end user!)

If it's an *unexpected* error message, here is what you can do:

* run qibuild with ``-v`` flag to display debug messages

* run qibuild with ``--backtrace`` to print the full backtrace

* run qibuild with ``--pdb`` to drop to a pdb session when an uncaught exception is raised.

.. _qibuild-coding-guide-error-messages:

Error messages
--------------

Please do not overlook those. Often, when writing code you do something like::

  try:
     something_really_complicated()
  except SomeStrangeError, e:
     log.error("Error occured: %s", e)


Because you are in an hurry, and just are thinking "Great, I've handled the
exception, now I can go back to write some code ..."

The problem is: the end user does not care you are glad you have handled the
exception, he needs to **understand** what just happens.

So you need to take a step back, think a little. "What path would lead to
this exception? What was the end user probably doing? How can I help him
understand what went wrong, and how he can fix this?"

So here is a short list of do's and don'ts when you are writing your error
message.

* Wording should look like::

    Could not < description of what went wrong >
    <Detailed explanation>
    Please < suggestion of a solution >

  For instance::

    Could not open configuration file
    'path/to/inexistant.cfg' does not exist
    Please check your configuration.


* Put filenames between quotes. For instance, if you are using a path given
  via a GUI, or via a prompt, it's possible that you forgot to strip it before
  using it, thus trying to create ``'/path/to/foo '`` or ``'path/to/foo\n'``.
  Unless you are putting the filename between quotes, this kind of error is hard
  to find.


* Put commands to use like this::

    Please try running: `qibuild configure -c linux32 foo'


* Give information

  Code like this makes little kitten cry::

    try:
      with open(config_file, "w") as fp:
        config = fp.read()
    except IOError, err:
      raise Exception("Could not open config file for writing")


  It's not helpful at all!
  It does not answer those basic questions:

    * What was the config file?
    * What was the problem with opening the config file?
    * ...

  So the end user has **no clue** what to do...

  And the fix is so simple! Just add a few lines::

    try:
      with open(config_file, "w") as fp:
        config = fp.read()
    except IOError, err:
      mess   = "Could not open config '%s' file for writing\n" % config_file
      mess += "Error was: %s" % err
      raise Exception(mess)

  So the error message would then be ::

    Could not open '/etc/foo/bar.cfg' for writing
    Error was: [Errno 13] Permission denied

  Which is much more helpful.



* Suggest a solution

  This is the harder part, but it is nice if the user can figure out what to do
  next.

  Here are a few examples::

    $ qibuild configure -c foo

    Error: Invalid configuration foo
     * No toolchain named foo. Known toolchains are:
        ['linux32', 'linux64']
     * No custom cmake file for config foo found.
       (looked in /home/dmerejkowsky/work/tmp/qi/.qi/foo.cmake)


    $ qibuild install foo (when build dir does not exists)

    Error: Could not find build directory:
      /home/dmerejkowsky/work/tmp/qi/foo/build-linux64-release
    If you were trying to install the project, make sure that you have configured
    and built it first


    $ qibuild configure # when not in a worktree

    Error: Could not find a work tree. please try from a valid work tree,
    specify an existing work tree with '--work-tree {path}', or create a new
    work tree with 'qibuild init'


    $ qibuild configure # at the root for the worktree

    Error: Could not guess project name from the working tree. Please try
    from a subdirectory of a project or specify the name of the project.


Interacting with the user
--------------------------

Make sure you only ask user when you have absolutely no way
to do something smart by default

(See for instance how ``qibuild open`` ask when it has absolutely
no choice but to ask)

And when you ask, make sure the default action (pressing enter) will
do the smart thing.

Most people will not pay attention to the questions, (and they do not
have to), so make the default obvious.

(See for instance how ``qibuild config --wizard`` does it)


Adding new tests
-----------------

For historical reasons, lots of the qibuild tests still are using
``unittest``


You should add your new test using ``py.test`` instead.

Basically, for each python module there should be a matching
test module ::

  qisrc/foo.py
  qisrc/test/test_foo.py


Also, when adding a new action, a good idea is to try to write the
functionality of your action thinking of it as a library, then add tests for
the library, and only then add the action.

This makes writing tests much easier, and also makes refactoring easier.

An other way of saying this is that you should usually not find yourself using
`qibuild.run_action` *inside* the qibuild project, it's rather meant
to be used from a release script, for instance.

.. code-block:: python

    def continuous_tests():
        qibuild.run_action("qisrc.actions.pull")
        qibuild.run_action("qibuild.actions.configure")
        qibuild.run_action("qibuild.actions.make")
        qibuild.run_action("qibuild.actions.test")
