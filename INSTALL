qiBuild Install
===============

Using the git repository
-------------------------

Use this method if you wish to use qibuild from the git repository.

After this is done, you just have to pull the git repository to
have an up-to-date qibuild.

This is the preferred method right now.


Linux, Mac
+++++++++++

Simply run::

  ./install-qibuild.sh

Windows
+++++++


* Make sure ``c:\Python27`` and ``c:\Python27\scripts`` are in ``%PATH%``
  (adapt these paths to reflect your Python's installation)

Then run::

  install-qibuild.bat


qicd
++++

If you want to use `qicd` from your shell, you have to :

* run install-qibuild.sh
* source the ``python/bin/qicd.sh`` script in you ``~/.profile`` or similar

(Tested with bash and zsh, works on mingwin's bash on Windows, too)


Packaging qibuild
-----------------

On linux
+++++++++

If you want to package qibuild for a linux distribution, you have to take care
of the following:

  - Install the python part of qibuild (for the command line to work)
  - Install the CMake part of qibuild (to use qibuild CMake function without depending on the command line)
  - Install the HTML documentation
  - Install the man pages of qibuild

This is taken care of by the ``CMakeLists.txt`` at the root of the qibuild repository

It will:

  - find the correct python version  (python2.6 or 2.7), configure a setup.py file and
    run ``setup.py install``
  - install the cmake part of qibuild to /usr/share/cmake/qibuild/
  - run sphinx-build to build the html documentation of qibuild to /usr/share/qibuild/doc/html/
  - run sphinx-build to build the man pages

On other platforms
++++++++++++++++++

Right now there are no plans to package qibuild on Mac or Windows. Ideas welcome ;)
